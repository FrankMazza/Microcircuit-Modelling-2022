# Microcircuit-Modelling-2022
Repository for getting started in the Microcircuit Modelling stream of KCNI's 2022 Summer School

Hi all, I'm one of the T.A's for the Microcircuit Modelling stream of KCNI's 2022 Summer School. The main project is simulating a ketamine effect on cortical neuronal networks in depression.

The project will simulate spiking activity in simplified neuronal networks in health, depression, and depression + ketamine conditions. The simulated activity will reproduce baseline and response firing rates, in a network of simplified neurons belonging to key types in the cortex. The project will model the effect of ketamine on specific neuronal mechanisms and neuron types in the network.
